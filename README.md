## Overview

Easily Missed is a web application designed to help iNaturalist observers identify gaps in species records within their local area. By suggesting which species should be observed and reported on iNaturalist, it assists in building a more complete picture of local wildlife.

## Getting Started

- Visit [Easily Missed](https://simonrolph.github.io/easily_missed/) to access the web app.
- To understand how to use the app, click on the "Getting started" link on the page.

## How It Works

Easily Missed creates a list of species recorded within your region, typically within 5 kilometers of your location. It helps prioritize species to fill data gaps by identifying species that haven't been recorded in your immediate vicinity, usually within 1 kilometer. Here's how it works:

1. The tool builds a list of species recorded in your region.
2. It prioritizes species not recorded in your local area, effectively filling data gaps.
3. By doing this, you improve your area's "doughnut score," representing the percentage of species recorded locally compared to the wider region.

Advanced users can customize the radius of the doughnut and the doughnut hole. Additionally, you can provide parameters in the tool's URL to affect the data retrieved from iNaturalist.

## Advanced Options

You can customize the following options:

- Inner circle radius (km): Adjust the radius of the inner circle.
- Outer circle radius (km): Modify the radius of the outer circle.
- Latitude and Longitude: Manually set the location.
